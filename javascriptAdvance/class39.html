<!-- Api request and more on this class  here we would work in js but with 
so it is html file here we would add script below

<!-- what is Ajax = asynchronous JavaScript and xml  it is not a technology itself but 
rather an approach to using a number of existing technologies togethere, 
including HTML or XHTML, css JavaScript, DOM, XML, XSLT, and most importantly 
XMLHttpRequest object. When these thechnologies are combined in the Ajax model, web
application are able to make quick, increamental updates to the user interface without 
reloading the entire browser page

<!--
 The XMLHttpRequest.readyState property returns the state an XMLHttpRequest client is in. 
 An XHR client exists in one of the following states:

Value	State	Description
0	UNSENT	Client has been created. open() not called yet.
1	OPENED	open() has been called.
2	HEADERS_RECEIVED	send() has been called, and headers and status are available.
3	LOADING	Downloading; responseText holds partial data.
4	DONE	The operation is complete.
