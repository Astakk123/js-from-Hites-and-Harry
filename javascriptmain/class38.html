    this is how we changed the inner text of the h1 from chai aur code to best js series but 
    when we try to change it after 4 second then how? lets see

    //    We will use the settimeout which is a function lets understand what is it ?

    // setTimeout(function (){
    //     console.log("Asta")  // this print Asta after 4 second because settimeout is 4000 because it in milisecond
    // }, 4000)

    // we can write the same in different style see how?
    const sayMyName = function () {
        console.log("Asta")
    }
    // setTimeout( sayMyName, 4000)  
    /*
    this is how we write the above first setTimeout  in different style, here we just store the whole function 
    in the variable saymyName and then put this variable as reference in the settimeout function you can see, 
    *remember this is the variable is taken as reference not as method so don't use parenthesis after the variable
    i.e sayMyName(), it will be wrong
    */

    // Now let's see we will change the chai aur Code to Best js series after 2 second which was our main goal

    const changeText = function () {
        document.querySelector('h1').innerHTML = "Best Js"
    }

    // setTimeout(changeText, 2000)

    // now it is time to learn what to do when want to stop this function, this is done using clearTimeout

    clearTimeout()
    /*to execute it we have to give reference that what settimeout has to be stopped so let's store the 
    setTimeOut(changeText,2000) and give this reference. See How?
    */
    const stoptimeout = setTimeout(changeText, 2000)
    // to execute clearTimeout() we give the stoptimeout reference 

    // clearTimeout(stoptimeout) 
    //we first set time out and then cleared but we want a switch that will help to stop the set timeout and hence execution when we click on that button

    document.querySelector('#stop').addEventListener('click', function () {
        clearTimeout(stoptimeout)
    })

// when we do this this stop button get powered and when this chari aur code to best js changes in 2 sec and if we click on the stop button in between this 2 sec then it will clear the settimeout and it will not change
