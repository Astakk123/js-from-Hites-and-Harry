+++++++++++++++++ Here in this class we discussed a lot DOM ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
(1) How to target something and work on that using console 
(2) we used the webpage of the class31 and played a lot 
To target anything what to do is first write the document in console or in script

Ex - here 

document.getElementById("title")

this is how we target an element by that's id here the id of the element is title the basic 
about this is first we select document by typing document then a dot then getElementById it 
will target the element navigating the id and as we know it is a method then we have to give 
a parenthesis after it and we have to assign a parameter which is the id of the element here 
it is title then it will give the full element 

then we can access anything that is in side the element using this only see how 

document.getElementById('title').id   | it will show the title because the id is title 
document.getElementById('title').class | it will not give anything show undefined to get class have to write className 
document.getElementById('title').className | it will give the heading because class is heading 

we can access the attribute of the all, see how?

document.getElementById('title').getAttribute('id')  | here the result is title because id is title 
document.getElementById('title').getAttribute('class') | here the result is heading because class is heading 

we can set the attribute and many more here, see how ?

document.getElementById('title').setAttribute('class', 'test')   
it will set the class test and it will overwrite the first one  which is very very important to remember the old 
class we had given will not be there in the element after doing this to keep the style same we shoule add another
class using the old class name 

we should store this in a variable to easily access, see how 

document.getElemtnById('title')  we have to store in the name of title, see how 
const title = document.getElemtnById('title')  Now the title is enough to access the whole element,  see how 

    title.style.color = 'white '
    title.style.backgroundColor = 'black'
    title.style.padding = '12px'
    title.style.boarderRadius = "15px"

these are the style added in the element the title represents the documetn.getElementById('title')
and its value is the wholw element and like the above we can add the style and many more 

++++++++++++++ interesting part how to add content and finding content +++++++++++++++++++++++++

From now we will only use the title instead of document.getElementById('title') because 
we have stored this long line in the variable title in the line 38 

finding content 

title.innerText     | thsi will not show the content if we have use display none  
title.textContent  | Used when we have to see all the content even the display none is used in the style
title.innerHTML     | and it will show the whole line meand html value, like  span or style added in the element even when 

------------------------ Using getElementByClassName() ----------------------

ex-
    title.getElementByClassName('heading') | here the calss name is heading and here we get the HTML Collection
    what is html collection? has to be selected all 


+++++++++++++++++++++ Using querrySelector +++++++++++++++++++++

document.querySelector('h1')   | the result is it gives one h1 of the page  

whey do we wrote the document instead of title? we know we have stored the document.getElementById("title") in a title. here we are not finding the element we are finding h1 or p so here we are using document because we want the h1 or p out of the document not in the specific element ok clear 

another is here 

document.querySelector('#title') it will select and show the id because we have selected the id
